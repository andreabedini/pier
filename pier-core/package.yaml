synopsis: A library for writing forwards-declared build systems in haskell.
description: |
    A library for writing build systems in Haskell, built on top of
    <http://shakebuild.com shake>.

    Pier provides a generic approach to building and caching file outputs.
    It enables build actions to be written in a "forwards" style, which
    generally leads to simpler logic than backwards-defined build systems
    such as make or (normal) Shake, where each step of the build logic must
    be written as a new build rule.

    For more details, see "Pier.Core.Artifact".
